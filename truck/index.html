      <h2>2007 Classic Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD Diesel</h2>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Up for sale is my 2007 Classic Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD, with the LBZ
        Duramax Diesel. It is a single cab, long bed truck, 2 wheel drive. This
        truck is a pre-emissions diesel, which means it has no DPF filter or any
        of the associated problematic hardware. I've owned this truck since
        August of 2020, when I purchased it from the city of Henderson, Nevada.
        As far as I can tell, prior to my ownership it was a maintenance vehicle
        and never actually towed a trailer. In my ownership I've used it to tow
        a small U-Haul trailer around town a handful of times, and it has spent
        the majority of my ownership as a garage queen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mechanically, the truck is 100% stock, and has never been modified or
        tuned. The only modifications I made were for creature comforts on the
        inside, which included swapping in better seats and a slightly nicer
        interior. If you're familiar with the GMT800 trucks, it was most of the
        way from a W/T spec to something closer to an LS trim level.
      </p>

      <p>
        I purchased the truck with 136,079 miles, and as it currently sits, it
        has 139,350. Upon purchase, I went from bumper to bumper on the truck
        and changed every fluid and filter, including engine oil (and filter),
        transmission fluid (and both the internal and external filter), fuel
        filter, air filter, rear differential fluid. I also purchased new OEM AC
        Delco brake pads front and rear, but discovered the truck didn't need
        them. The full exhaustive list of fixes and upgrades are below.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h4>Why are you selling it?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I've owned the truck for 5 years, and have put 3,000 miles on it. It's
          just too nice to sit. These trucks were made to work!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What does it need?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The steering is about 10x better than when I bought it, but in reality
          it would probably be better with a pitman arm replacement (as I've
          replaced everything else). I just never got back to it. Beyond that,
          it is probably due for an oil change (because of time, not mileage),
          which is why I am including everything to do it, but not doing it
          myself. I figure anyone that buys this, and cares about it, will end
          up changing it either way, and it felt like a waste to put new oil in
          now.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Any outstanding issues?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because it's parked more than it drives, the tires have very mild flat
          spots, which would go away with some regular use. Beyond that, as far
          as I am aware, the truck is mechanically ready to go.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Is it rusty or have any corrosion?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The truck left Southern Nevada exactly one time, and that was a trip
          to Arizona. As a former midwesterner, it still blows my mind how clean
          and new this truck looks underneath.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Will you take a trade?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I might, but it would have to be pretty compelling. I am interested in
          remarkably clean GMT800 or some very clean GMT900 trucks (mostly in
          the realm of a Yukon Denali or Cadillac Escalade), trailers (dual axle
          small dumps or possibly a landscaping type trailer). I am happy to
          consider anything you might have though, as long as it is reasonable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>What's the deal with the cap?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The cap is a Leer, but it's seen better days. It is still perfectly
          usable, but sadly the last time I took it off, one of the side windows
          broke. I'm certain it's not a huge expense to fix, but given I don't
          typically use it, I haven't taken the time to replace it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>How firm are you on price?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am pretty certain that I am in the ballpark of what these trucks are
          worth. They are rare, being pre-emission and not completely beat to
          pieces. I also don't really need to sell it, but feel bad about how
          much it sits. That said: happy to consider offers, but if you're going
          to lowball me, don't expect a reply.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Do you hold the title? Will you finance?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have the title, and it is clear. The truck has never been in an
          accident. I accept cash, and in some cases a cashier's check. I will
          not finance you, sorry.
        </li>
      </ul>
